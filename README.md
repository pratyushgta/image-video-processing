# Image & Video Processing Experiments
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide range of topics that were covered during my 3rd-year of Computer Engineering.

## Experiments
#### 1. Image Initialization
- Inputting Image
- Plotting Image
- Darkening Image
#### 1. Image Enhancement
- Digital Negative
- Thresholding
- Contrast Stretching
- Intensity slicing with and without background
#### 2. Image Manipulations
- Changing the resolution of the image
- Downsampling the image
- Upsampling the image
#### 3. Histogram Equalization
#### 4. Spatial Filtering
- Gaussian noise removal using averaging filter sizes 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11
- Gaussian noise removal using weighted averaging filter of size 3x3
- Salt & Pepper noise removal using median filter
#### 5. Image Transforms
- Hadamard transform
- Walsh transform
- Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
#### 6. Image Enhancement
- Erosion with square structuring element of size 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11
- Dilation with square structuring element of size 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11
- Opening with square structuring element of size 11x11
